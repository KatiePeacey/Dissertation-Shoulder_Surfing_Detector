Deep learning in computer vision is one of the most actively developing areas in modern technologies, allowing to automate the processes of analysis and recognition of objects in images. The YOLO (You Only Look Once) model is one of the most effective and widely used methods for real-time object detection. The study covers the main steps of working with the YOLOv8 model, from installing and configuring the necessary libraries and development environment, to training the model on the provided data and evaluating its performance. We present a detailed analysis of the training process, including selection of optimal hyperparameters, tuning of training parameters and data augmentation.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to introduce and quickly make a reader familiar with OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) basics without having to go through the lengthy reference manuals and books. OpenCV is an open source library for image and video analysis, originally introduced more than decade ago by Intel. Since then, a number of programmers have contributed to the most recent library developments. The latest major change took place in 2009 (OpenCV 2) which includes main changes to the C++ interface. Nowadays the library has {\textgreater}2500 optimized algorithms. It is extensively used around the world, having {\textgreater}2.5M downloads and {\textgreater}40K people in the user group. Regardless of whether one is a novice C++ programmer or a professional software developer, unaware of OpenCV, the main library content should be interesting for the graduate students and researchers in image processing and computer vision areas. To master every library element it is necessary to consult many books available on the topic of OpenCV. However, reading such more comprehensive material should be easier after comprehending some basics about OpenCV from this paper.},

	abstract = {Dynamic features in programming languages support the modification of the execution status at runtime, which is often considered helpful in rapid development and prototyping. However, it was also reported that some dynamic feature code tends to be change-prone or error-prone. We present the first study that analyzes the changes of dynamic feature code and the roles of dynamic features in bug-fix activities for the Python language. We used an AST-based differencing tool to capture fine-grained source code changes from 17926 bug-fix commits in 17 Python projects. Using this data, we conducted an empirical study on the changes of dynamic feature code when fixing bugs in Python. First, we investigated the characteristics of dynamic feature code changes, by comparing the changes between dynamic feature code and non-dynamic feature code when fixing bugs, and comparing dynamic feature changes between bug-fix and non-bugfix activities. Second, we explored 226 bug-fix commits to investigate the motivation and behaviors of dynamic feature changes when fixing bugs. The study results reveal that (1) the changes of dynamic feature code are significantly related to bug-fix activities rather than non-bugfix activities; (2) compared with non-dynamic feature code, dynamic feature code is inserted or updated more frequently when fixing bugs; (3) developers often insert dynamic feature code as type checks or attribute checks to fix type errors and attribute errors; (4) the misuse of dynamic features introduces bugs in dynamic feature code, and the bugs are often fixed by adding a check or adding an exception handling. As a benefit of this paper, we gain insights into the manner in which developers and researchers handle the changes of dynamic feature code when fixing bugs.},

We show how using appropriate priors exploiting the structure of image data helps with ef-ficient feature selection. Different regularization strategies and its importance to combat overfitting are also investi-gated.

We cannot avoid these dangers entirely, for were we to do so, we would fail to cope with the real problems and hazards of the field.The second part of the paper is intended to illustrate the first part through the example of tradeoff analysis. Any single design technique is apt to have its virtues along one dimension compensated by deficiencies along another. Tradeoff analysis provides a quantitative method of assessing tradeoff relations for two attributes xi and xj by first determining the User Satisfaction function for each, U(x), then showing how U(xi) trades off against U(xj). In general, the User Satisfaction for a system is given by the weighted sum of the User Satisfaction values for the attributes. The analysis is used to examine two different tradeoffs of information versus time and editor workspace versus menu size. Tradeoffs involving command languages versus menu-based systems, choices of names, and handheld computers versus workstations are examined briefly.},

We present ShotjldAR, a mobile and usable system to detect SSAs using multimodal eye gaze information (i.e., from both the potential attacker and victim). ShouldAR uses an augmented reality headset as a platform to incorporate user eye gaze tracking, rear-facing image collection and eye gaze analysis, and user notification of potential attacks. In a 24-participant study, we show that the prototype is capable of detecting 87.28\% of SSAs against both physical and digital targets, a two-fold improvement on the baseline solution using a rear-facing mirror, a widely used solution to the SSA problem. The ShouldAR approach provides an AR-based, active SSA defense that applies to both digital and physical information entry in sensitive environments.},

When analyzing the most common attacks and the reasons for successful frauds, it becomes apparent that the main problem lies in the PIN based authentication which in itself does not provide any security features (besides the use of asterisks). That is, security is solely based on a user's behavior. Indirect input is one way to solve this problem. This mostly comes at the costs of adding overhead to the input process. We present ColorPIN, an authentication mechanism that uses indirect input to provide security enhanced PIN entry. At the same time, ColorPIN remains a one-to-one relationship between the length of the PIN and the required number of clicks. A user study showed that ColorPIN is significantly more secure than standard PIN entry while enabling good authentication speed in comparison with related systems.},

We present one instantiation, the Spy-Resistant Keyboard, and discuss design decisions leading to the development of this keyboard. We also describe the results of a user study exploring the usability and security of our interface. Results indicate that although users took longer to enter their passwords, using the Spy-Resistant Keyboard rather than a standard soft keyboard resulted in a significant increase in their ability to protect their passwords from a watchful observer.},

Participants in a prior study expressed concerns that this increase in memorability could also lead to an increased susceptibility of graphical passwords to shoulder-surfing. This appears to be yet another example of the classic trade-off between usability and security for authentication systems. This paper explores whether graphical passwords' increased memorability necessarily leads to risks of shoulder-surfing. To date, there are no studies examining the vulnerability of graphical versus alphanumeric passwords to shoulder-surfing.This paper examines the real and perceived vulnerability to shoulder-surfing of two configurations of a graphical password, Passfaces™[30], compared to non-dictionary and dictionary passwords. A laboratory experiment with 20 participants asked them to try to shoulder surf the two configurations of Passfaces™ (mouse versus keyboard data entry) and strong and weak passwords. Data gathered included the vulnerability of the four authentication system configurations to shoulder-surfing and study participants' perceptions concerning the same vulnerability. An analysis of these data compared the relative vulnerability of each of the four configurations to shoulder-surfing and also compared study participants' real and perceived success in shoulder-surfing each of the configurations. Further analysis examined the relationship between study participants' real and perceived success in shoulder-surfing and determined whether there were significant differences in the vulnerability of the four authentication configurations to shoulder-surfing.Findings indicate that configuring data entry for Passfaces™ through a keyboard is the most effective deterrent to shoulder-surfing in a laboratory setting and the participants' perceptions were consistent with that result. While study participants believed that Passfaces™ with mouse data entry would be most vulnerable to shoulder-surfing attacks, the empirical results found that strong passwords were actually more vulnerable.},

	abstract = {Facial recognition has become the surge on mobile authentication scenarios and makes up a huge market share for various apps, such as MasterCard, Google Wallet, and AliPay. However, existing solutions suffer from various impersonation attacks, including photo-spoofing attack, video-replay attack, and 3D facial mask attack. State-of-the-art countermeasures either require additional user intervention or introduce specialized high-end sensors. Even introducing these extra efforts, these approaches still hardly defend the latest 3D facial mask attacks, which gradually become accessible due to the prevalence of low-cost 3D printing. In this paper, we propose an anti-spoofing facial recognition system, PassFace, which verifies the smartphone for authentication as the second factor merely using raw facial videos without any user intervention, to defeat impersonation attacks. In particular, when receiving a user’s selfie video, PassFace identifies the user’s face from the video, and meanwhile extracts the highly unique and physically irreproducible camera fingerprint, i.e., Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU), built in the smartphone from key frames of the video. After that, the system compares the Peak to Correlation Energy (PCE) calculated by the estimated PRNU and the reference profile with a threshold for authentication. Experiment results demonstrate PassFace can achieve satisfactory performance in authentication and attack resistance.},

	abstract = {Displays are growing in size, and are increasingly deployed in semi-public and public areas. When people use these public displays to pursue personal work, they expose their activities and sensitive data to passers-by. In most cases, such shoulder-surfing by others is likely voyeuristic vs. a deliberate attempt to steal information. Even so, safeguards are needed. Our goal is to mitigate shoulder-surfing problems in such settings. Our method leverages notions of territoriality and proxemics, where we sense and take action based on the spatial relationships between the passerby, the user of the display, and the display itself. First, we provide participants with awareness of shoulder-surfing moments, which in turn helps both parties regulate their behaviours and mediate further social interactions. Second, we provide methods that protect information when shoulder-surfing is detected. Here, users can move or hide information through easy to perform explicit actions. Alternately, the system itself can mask information from the passerby's view when it detects shoulder-surfing moments.},

In this paper, we present an observation made during an empirical evaluation of several input techniques, showing that the cognitive load occurring during user input can significantly reduce perceived time. We provide a discussion of our findings, proposing that existing work in cognitive psychology, such as the Cognitive-Timer Model is applicable to HCI; and that this understanding can provide valuable information for predicting and actively modeling perceived input performance when designing user interfaces.},

	abstract = {Given the nature of mobile devices and unlock procedures, unlock authentication is a prime target for credential leaking via shoulder surfing, a form of an observation attack. While the research community has investigated solutions to minimize or prevent the threat of shoulder surfing, our understanding of how the attack performs on current systems is less well studied. In this paper, we describe a large online experiment (n = 1173) that works towards establishing a baseline of shoulder surfing vulnerability for current unlock authentication systems. Using controlled video recordings of a victim entering in a set of 4- and 6-length PINs and Android unlock patterns on different phones from different angles, we asked participants to act as attackers, trying to determine the authentication input based on the observation. We find that 6-digit PINs are the most elusive attacking surface where a single observation leads to just 10.8\% successful attacks (26.5\% with multiple observations). As a comparison, 6-length Android patterns, with one observation, were found to have an attack rate of 64.2\% (79.9\% with multiple observations). Removing feedback lines for patterns improves security to 35.3\% (52.1\% with multiple observations). This evidence, as well as other results related to hand position, phone size, and observation angle, suggests the best and worst case scenarios related to shoulder surfing vulnerability which can both help inform users to improve their security choices, as well as establish baselines for researchers.},

	abstract = {Research has brought forth a variety of authentication systems to mitigate observation attacks. However, there is little work about shoulder surﬁng situations in the real world. We present the results of a user survey (N=174) in which we investigate actual stories about shoulder surﬁng on mobile devices from both users and observers. Our analysis indicates that shoulder surﬁng mainly occurs in an opportunistic, nonmalicious way. It usually does not have serious consequences, but evokes negative feelings for both parties, resulting in a variety of coping strategies. Observed data was personal in most cases and ranged from information about interests and hobbies to login data and intimate details about third persons and relationships. Thus, our work contributes evidence for shoulder surﬁng in the real world and informs implications for the design of privacy protection mechanisms.},
