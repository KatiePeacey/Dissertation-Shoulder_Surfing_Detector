	abstract = {In ubiquitous textual password schemes, users choose passwords that contain predictable character-istics that are roughly equated with what users find easy to recall. This motivates us to examine user choice in graphical passwords to determine whether predictable characteristics exist that may reduce the entropy of the password space. We present an informal user study of the scheme proposed by Jermyn et al. (1999), and the results, both in context of the study's goals and a separate analysis of the results performed at a later date. Our results support that user drawings contain the predictable characteris-tics relating to symmetry, number of composite strokes, and centering within the grid. Our results also highlight a usability challenge with the DAS scheme.},

	abstract = {Facial recognition has become the surge on mobile authentication scenarios and makes up a huge market share for various apps, such as MasterCard, Google Wallet, and AliPay. However, existing solutions suffer from various impersonation attacks, including photo-spoofing attack, video-replay attack, and 3D facial mask attack. State-of-the-art countermeasures either require additional user intervention or introduce specialized high-end sensors. Even introducing these extra efforts, these approaches still hardly defend the latest 3D facial mask attacks, which gradually become accessible due to the prevalence of low-cost 3D printing. In this paper, we propose an anti-spoofing facial recognition system, PassFace, which verifies the smartphone for authentication as the second factor merely using raw facial videos without any user intervention, to defeat impersonation attacks. In particular, when receiving a user’s selfie video, PassFace identifies the user’s face from the video, and meanwhile extracts the highly unique and physically irreproducible camera fingerprint, i.e., Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU), built in the smartphone from key frames of the video. After that, the system compares the Peak to Correlation Energy (PCE) calculated by the estimated PRNU and the reference profile with a threshold for authentication. Experiment results demonstrate PassFace can achieve satisfactory performance in authentication and attack resistance.},

	abstract = {Displays are growing in size, and are increasingly deployed in semi-public and public areas. When people use these public displays to pursue personal work, they expose their activities and sensitive data to passers-by. In most cases, such shoulder-surfing by others is likely voyeuristic vs. a deliberate attempt to steal information. Even so, safeguards are needed. Our goal is to mitigate shoulder-surfing problems in such settings. Our method leverages notions of territoriality and proxemics, where we sense and take action based on the spatial relationships between the passerby, the user of the display, and the display itself. First, we provide participants with awareness of shoulder-surfing moments, which in turn helps both parties regulate their behaviours and mediate further social interactions. Second, we provide methods that protect information when shoulder-surfing is detected. Here, users can move or hide information through easy to perform explicit actions. Alternately, the system itself can mask information from the passerby's view when it detects shoulder-surfing moments.},

	abstract = {Given the nature of mobile devices and unlock procedures, unlock authentication is a prime target for credential leaking via shoulder surfing, a form of an observation attack. While the research community has investigated solutions to minimize or prevent the threat of shoulder surfing, our understanding of how the attack performs on current systems is less well studied. In this paper, we describe a large online experiment (n = 1173) that works towards establishing a baseline of shoulder surfing vulnerability for current unlock authentication systems. Using controlled video recordings of a victim entering in a set of 4- and 6-length PINs and Android unlock patterns on different phones from different angles, we asked participants to act as attackers, trying to determine the authentication input based on the observation. We find that 6-digit PINs are the most elusive attacking surface where a single observation leads to just 10.8\% successful attacks (26.5\% with multiple observations). As a comparison, 6-length Android patterns, with one observation, were found to have an attack rate of 64.2\% (79.9\% with multiple observations). Removing feedback lines for patterns improves security to 35.3\% (52.1\% with multiple observations). This evidence, as well as other results related to hand position, phone size, and observation angle, suggests the best and worst case scenarios related to shoulder surfing vulnerability which can both help inform users to improve their security choices, as well as establish baselines for researchers.},

	abstract = {Research has brought forth a variety of authentication systems to mitigate observation attacks. However, there is little work about shoulder surﬁng situations in the real world. We present the results of a user survey (N=174) in which we investigate actual stories about shoulder surﬁng on mobile devices from both users and observers. Our analysis indicates that shoulder surﬁng mainly occurs in an opportunistic, nonmalicious way. It usually does not have serious consequences, but evokes negative feelings for both parties, resulting in a variety of coping strategies. Observed data was personal in most cases and ranged from information about interests and hobbies to login data and intimate details about third persons and relationships. Thus, our work contributes evidence for shoulder surﬁng in the real world and informs implications for the design of privacy protection mechanisms.},
